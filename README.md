## Resource/Provider

## mysql\_windows\_service

Execute install and uninstallation of MySQL. Also, if the attribute root_password is defined, then the root's password is set at the end of the installation

### Actions

- **install (default)**
- **uninstall**

### Attribute Parameters
- **installation_name**: Name of the installation. It can be defined as the resource name. (Mandatory)
- **msi\_url\_path**: absoute url where the installer is placed. This value may be specified as HTTP `(http://)`, FTP `(ftp://)`, or local `(file://)` source file locations. (Mandatory)
- **msi\_url\_file**: filename of the msi installer. Is used along with `msi_url_path` attribute to get the full download link. (Mandatory)
- **installation_path**: used to define where is or is going to be installed MySQL. 
- **root_password**: defines the password that is going to be set when installing MySQL. If the password is already set because of an old installation, it won't be set again and a warning will be shown. This only works for installation action. More than six letters are required.

### Examples

Run installation, using a local msi installer (c:\mysql-essential-5.0.51a-winx64.msi) and set password for root:

```ruby
mysql_windows_service "MySQL Server 5.0" do
  msi_url_path        'file://c:'
  msi_url_file        'mysql-essential-5.0.51a-winx64.msi'
  root_password		  'devtest'
end
```

Run uninstallation, setting remove_completely to true in order to fully delete MySQL.

```ruby
node.set[:mysql_windows][:lwrp][:remove_completely] = true

mysql_windows_service "MySQL Server 5.0" do
  msi_url_path        'http://s3.amazonaws.com/windows'
  msi_url_file        'mysql-essential-5.0.51a-winx64.msi'
  action              :uninstall
end

```

## mysql\_windows\_password

Execute password set, either setting root password for a fresh installation or any other existent user.

### Actions

- **change (default)**: Change the password for a specific user. 
- **change_initial\_root**: Change the root password for a fresh installation.

### Attribute Parameters

- **execution\_user\_name**: user that has enough permissions to execute the password change command in MySQL.
- **execution\_user\_pass**: password for the _execution\_user\_name_ typed
- **user_name**: UserName for which the password is going to be changed
- **user_pass**: Password for the _user\_name_ typed
- **installation\_path**: Installation path where MySQL is installed. You can either include _/bin_ at the end of the _installation\_path_ or leave it like that. If MYSQL_PATH/bin is already added to PATH env variable, this could be omitted.

### Examples


Changing password for user `new_user` using `root` as the user that executes the password.

```ruby
mysql_windows_password "Changing passowrd" do
	installation_path 'C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\bin'
	execution_user_name 'root'	
	execution_user_pass 'devtest'
	user_name 'new_user'
	user_pass 'devtest'
end 
```

Changing password for user `other_user` using `new_user` as the user that executes the password.

```ruby
mysql_windows_password "Changing passowrd" do
	execution_user_name 'new_user'	
	execution_user_pass 'devtest'
	user_name 'another_user'
	user_pass 'mypass'
end 
```

Changing initial root password providing the installation_path

```ruby
mysql_windows_password "Changing root password for the first time" do
	installation_path 'C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0'
	user_pass 'devtest'
	action :change_initial_root
end
```

Changing initial root password whithouth providing installation_path as MYSQL_PATH/bin is already included in PATH

```ruby

	action :change_initial_root
end
